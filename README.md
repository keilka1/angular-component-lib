# Agnular Component Library
This application is a component UI library that can be used in Angular Applications including a card list that can be re-ordered using drag and drop features and a button for copying content to the clipboard. The library was also published to the npm registry so it can be used in other projects. Also, a custom element for distribution to non-angular applications was created.
